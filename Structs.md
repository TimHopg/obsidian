Structures (struct) are a way to group several related variables of different data types together.

Declare in pointer:

```C
struct MyStructure { // Structure declaration
	int myNum; // Member (int variable)
	char myLetter; // Member (char variable)
	}; // End the structure with a semicolon
```

`struct1.myNum` - dot operator to access members/fields of structs
`struct myStructure s1 = {13, 'B', "Some text"};` - quick assign
