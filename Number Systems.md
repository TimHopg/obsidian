#### Binary
Binary numbers are expressed with a leading `0b` in C but it's not part of the C standard so some compilers may not recognise this notation. It's best to use `0x` to be safe.
#### Octal
Octal numbers are expressed with a leading `0` in C.
`int octal = 012` - decimal: 10
#### Hex
Hex numbers are expressed with a leading `0x` in C.
