* Change the type of a variable to see every point where the compiler throws an error
* Or narrow the scope of a variable to see if it is being used incorrectly in other parts of the code
#### VS Code
Command palette > Edit Config JSON

Right click on breakpoints to the left to change the type of breakpoint (add expression, create hit count, etc.)
