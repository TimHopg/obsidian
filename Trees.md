Root node and leaf nodes. Links are called edges (but sometimes links).  
They are built like linked lists.  
Recursion is frequently used with trees because all nodes resemble each other. e.g. printing, traversing etc.
## Binary Tree

Means each note can have a maximum of two children.  
Binary tree will have two `next` nodes, sometimes `left` and `right`.
