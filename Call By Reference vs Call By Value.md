#todo #Programming #C_Language 

```C
By value:
void function(int a)
{a = 0;}
By reference:
void function (int *a)
{*a = 0;}
```

Value makes a copy when called in the main function.
Reference sends the reference to the physical variable. Any changes made will be reflected in main function.

This is the power of pointers!
