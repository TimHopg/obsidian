#Maths 

A number that can only be divided by 1 and itself.
`2, 3, 5, 7, 11...`
1 is not a prime because it can only be divided by one number.

A prime is a `nbr` where no `n` exists that `nbr % n = 0` (where `n < nbr` and `n > 1`).
Every `n` between `1` and `nbr` where `nbr % n` will produce a result other than zero.

```C
if nbr <= 1 // not prime
  ret 0

if nbr == 2 // prime

//if nbr % 2 == 0 
while (i < nbr / i)
if nbr % i == 0 -> not prime
i += 2;
```
